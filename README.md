**Note:** _We will rotate note taking responsibilities for each general body team meeting.
For the mentor meetings and discussion, those present (as it is optional) will alternate who
takes notes for each event. The notes template can be found 
[here](https://github.com/ntrappe/cse112-s22-group2/wiki/Meeting-Note-Guide). All notes
should be uploaded to the **Wiki**._
